SSd1309 with pi pico for python convert bitmaps
using ssd1309 library for micropython
- there are a lot of internal files saved to the pico that are not here (*_^)
- uf2 file: https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/
- example ssd code : https://github.com/rdagger/micropython-ssd1309/blob/master/demo_images.py
Will function as a holder for the arduino prjects to git
Bit map conversion JS for arduino SSD 1309 display from canvas drawings

SSD1309 game dev work

bed lights saved here too
